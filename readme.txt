This plugin allows Portuguese costumers to pay WooCommerce orders with Multibanco (Pag. Serviços), using the IfthenPay gateway.

== Description ==

"Pagamento de Serviços" (service payment) on Multibanco (the Portuguese ATM network), or on Home Banking services, is the most popular way of paying services and (online) purchases in Portugal. The Portuguese consumer trusts in the "Multibanco" system more than any other.

This plugin will allow you to generate a payment Reference that the customer can then use to pay for his order on the ATM or Home Banking service. This plugin uses one of the several gateways/services available in Portugal, provided by IfthenPay, and a contract with this company is required.

This is NOT an official plugin by Ifthen, yet it has been tested with them and it's the most complete one available.

= Features: =

* Generates a Multibanco Reference for simple payment on the Portuguese ATM or Home Banking service network;
* Automaticaly changes the order status to "Processing (paid)" and notifies both the costumer and the store owner;
* Allows to search orders (on the admin area) by Reference;


== Installation ==

* Use the included automatic install feature on your WordPress admin panel and search for "Multibanco (IfthenPay gateway) for WooCommerce".
